Index 1. 

1. let there be an index numAdmissions(HName,Date,count(PatientID)) that keeps track of how many patients
Amdit to a certain hospital each they

2. This index will be non clustered and will be ordered by count(PatientID) in decsending order

3. This will greatly speed up question 7. To find the max day that the 'Hamilton General Hospital' had the largest patient 
Admissions, the DB Find the count of patient Admissions on every date for 'Hamilton General Hospital', Find the Date with the
Maximum admissions count and return it. Becuase the index present stores the admissions count everyday for Each hospital and its ordered in
decsending order, one search through the index will give you the result, hence improving the preformance significantly. 


Index 2.

1. Let there be an Index drugSales(DrugCode, totalSales) that contains the total revenue gerenated for every drug. Every time a sale
is made (when a new perscibtion is added), totalSales will increase by the unitcost of the drug

2. This index will be non clustered and will be ordered by totalSales in decsending order

3. Its intuitive to conclude that this will definetly speed up question 8. For question 8, you needed calculate the total revenue of each drug
by multiplying the amount of patients that perscibed with the unitcost and return thr drug code with the largest amount, which would always be
longer then one lookup in the drugSales index.
